    p.
        Purva is currently a 10th grader at Shenendehowa High School. Dance has
        been her passion since she was three years old when she started performing
        bollywood dances. At age six, she began taking Bharatanatyam lessons under
        the guidance of Guru Angana Patel and since then she has performed numerous
        times as a classical, semiclassical, and cinematic dancer. When she was nine,
        she began learning Bharatanatyam from Guru Sudharsana Srinivasan. She has
        frequently performed at TRICIA Spring Festivals, the HCC Diwali Celebrations,
        and several other events in the region. Some of her other passions include
        playing the violin, which she has been learning for the past seven years,
        painting, and playing on her schoolâ€™s tennis team. She is also an active
        participant in school organizations and clubs. She has been the President
        of National Junior Honors Society and Treasurer of her middle school Future
        Cities club. She is also a member of Class Council, SFA Senate, Math Honors
        Society, and Science Honors Society. In the years to come, she hopes that
        dance will always remain an integral part of her life.
